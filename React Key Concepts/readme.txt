1. The Birth of React.js
-- Created in 2013 by Facebook

2. Declarative vs Imperative
-- Imperative: "This is what you should do at each step." (Changing the state at each step)
-- Declarative: "It should look like this." (The final state should look like this)

(Analogy Example)
-- Imperative Response:
Go out of the north exit of the parking lot and take a left. 
Get on I-15 south until you get to the Main Highway exit. 
Take a right off the exit like youâ€™re going to Ikea. 
Go straight and take a right at the first light. 
Continue through the next light then take your next left. 
My house is #298.

-- Declarative response: 
My address is 298 West Immutable Alley, Draper Utah 84020

3. Component Architecture
-- Build websites like lego blocks (Diagram)
(Two ways to build components with JSX: Class & Functional)
-- Component Libraries (React Bootstrap, Material UI, etc)
-- React Developer Tools Extension

4. One Way Data Flow
-- Unidirectional Data Flow: Data only flows one way.
(Parent Component -> Child Component)
-- Data from parent is known as "props".
-- You can only transfer data from parent to child and not vice versa.
-- Benefits of this flow are Debugging, Better Control, Efficiency

5. UI Libraries
-- Core Libraries:
(React, ReactDOM)
-- Extras:
(React Desktop: Create desktop applications, React 360: create virtual reality applications, etc.)

6.RECAP: React Concepts:
(ReactDOM, Build websites like lego blocks, Unidirectional Data Flow, UI Libraries)
